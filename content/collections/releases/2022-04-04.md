New
- Brewers can use keg maintenance to help their brewery perform their keg maintenance on time. This feature will be rolled out to breweries soon.

Changed
- Brewers are required to submit their brewery name when requesting a demo on the home page.

Improved
- Taprooms are explained more clearly as "locations that your brewery operates."
- The custom icons in the menu and throughout the app have been updated for visual consistency.
- Track more analytics so the Distribrewtion team can understand how brewers use the scanner.
