New
- The landing page has been redesigned.
- Brewers are prompted to replace duplicate keg labels when they are scanned.

Improved
- Buyers have become Merchants. When creating a Merchant you'll be prompted to specify the type as either Retailer or Distributor. In future releases we'll add features specific to Retailers and Distributors.

Fixed
- On mobile the scanner no longer uses the camera when running in the background.
