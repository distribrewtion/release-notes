New
- Brewers can use price groups to add pricing information their beer profiles. This feature will be rolled out to breweries soon.
- Brewers can delete beer profiles to remove old ones they no longer use.

Changed
- Brewers are required to submit their brewery name when requesting a demo on the home page.

Improved
- Keg Maintenances and Beer Profiles now have "details" pages for brewers to see more information about them.
- The design of users, beer profiles, and keg maintenance, have been refreshed to be consistent with the new orders and price groups features.
- The account page has an improved layout to make the information easier to understand.
- The lists in keg inventory, keg tracking, and taprooms now consistently sort items by the keg size. This is especially important when two items in a list vary only by keg size.
