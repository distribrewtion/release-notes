Changed
- Redesign the structure of our service around producers, rather than breweries. This doesn't have much immediate change for the end user but will support future features.
- Producers are now required to provide an address representing their place of business.

Added
- Created an onboarding experience for new customers to get their account setup properly.
- Allow producers to specify their producer type (e.g. brewery, kombucha brewery, cidery).
- Allow producers to update their name and producer type.

Fixed
- Improved the search results when searching for addresses.
