New
- Buyers can be added directly from the "Delivered" scanner workflow.
- The Keg Info scanner mode shows Beer and Buyer information.

Fixed
- Addresses load reliably. This was a problem especially in long lists of Buyers.
- Adding Buyers works reliably. Previously, a bug made it was possible to create duplicate Buyers if the contact email address for the Buyer already existed in the system.
