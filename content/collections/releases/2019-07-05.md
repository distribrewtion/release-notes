New
- Keg tags can be replaced from the keg info screen.
- The demo environment shows a banner to help users understand it's not the real website.
- A new "showcase" environment was created for our sales team to use.

Improved
- The create keg tags page generates tags specific to the whatever environment is being used, rather than always for production.
- The scanner only accepts keg tags that are meant for whatever environment is being used (e.g. production, demo).
- The villains' test keg tag generator can now produce tags for any environment. Additionally it allows villains to choose between generating v1 or v3 tags.

Fixed
- The sort order in the beer profile selector
