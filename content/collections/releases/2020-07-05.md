New
- The consumed volume report can be broken down by buyers, cross-compared by beer profile.
- Breweries can be billed for their monthly service through Distribrewtion, replacing our external billing process.

Improved
- Each consumed volume report type can be printed and downloaded independently.
- The consumed volume report can be viewed in either barrels or gallons, allowing for a simpler layout.
- The consumed volume report "unknown volume" styling is easier to understand.
- Report printing now works on mobile.

Fixed
- Modals no longer unexpectedly loose keyboard focus when typing some characters (the "letter C bug").
- We normalize user email addresses to lower case to prevent login issues.
