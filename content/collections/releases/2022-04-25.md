Improved
- Scanner logic is rewritten almost from scratch along with its tests. There are no new features but the changes will make it easier for us to develop and maintain new scanner features.

Fixed
- Keg Info scanner now beeps when a keg is scanned.
- The "replace keg tag" camera view was squashed vertically. Now it shows properly.
