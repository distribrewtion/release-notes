Improved
- Rebuilt the scanner. This resolves an issue where some demo codes wouldn't scan. It also visually highlights QR codes found in the viewfinder. 
- Expansion lists only open one item at a time.

New
- Brewers can create taprooms and track their kegs at each taproom location.
- Kegs can now be updated as on tap and empty.
- On tap and empty kegs are now listed under keg tracking.
- Villains can edit buyers, even changing their type.

Changed
- Reworded the call-to-action for contacting sales on the homepage to say "Try It Out."

Fixed
- The application now properly remembers a login so users don't have to reenter their email address and password every time they visit the site.
